## Stack 

A stack is a fundamental data structure used in computer science and programming. It operates based on the principle of Last-In-First-Out (LIFO). This means that the most recently added (or "pushed") element is the first one to be removed (or "popped").

The two primary operations associated with a stack are:

1. Push: This operation adds an element to the collection. In a stack, the element is always added to the top.

2. Pop: This operation removes an element from the collection. In a stack, the topmost element is always the one removed.

Here are a few additional operations that are sometimes associated with a stack:

1. Peek / Top: This operation gets the top data element of the stack, without removing it.
2. IsEmpty: This operation checks whether the stack is empty.
3. IsFull: This operation checks whether the stack is full.
4. Stacks are useful in many situations where you want to reverse a sequence of items or where you want to store items in a specific order. They are used in many areas of programming, such as managing function calls (call stack), parsing (syntax stack), expressi
