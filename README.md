## Introduction to C Programming
In this section, you will learn the basics of the C programming language, including variables, control structures, functions, and pointers.

## Arrays
Arrays are a fundamental data structure used in many applications. In this section, you will learn how to declare, initialize, and manipulate arrays in C.

## Linked Lists
Linked lists are a popular data structure used to store data elements in a linked format. In this section, you will learn how to implement singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists in C.

## Stacks
A stack is a data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. In this section, you will learn how to implement a stack using an array and a linked list in C.

## Queues
A queue is a data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. In this section, you will learn how to implement a queue using an array and a linked list in C.

## Trees
Trees are a hierarchical data structure used to represent relationships between elements. In this section, you will learn how to implement binary trees, AVL trees, and red-black trees in C.

## Graphs
A graph is a non-linear data structure used to represent relationships between elements. In this section, you will learn how to implement graphs using an adjacency matrix and an adjacency list in C.

## Sorting Algorithms
Sorting algorithms are used to rearrange elements in a collection in a specific order. In this section, you will learn how to implement selection sort, bubble sort, insertion sort, quicksort, and mergesort in C.

## Searching Algorithms
Searching algorithms are used to find the location of a particular element in a collection. In this section, you will learn how to implement linear search, binary search, and interpolation search in C.

## Conclusion
This repository provides a comprehensive overview of data structures and their implementation in the C programming language. By studying these concepts and applying them to real-world problems, you will become a more proficient programmer and problem solver.
